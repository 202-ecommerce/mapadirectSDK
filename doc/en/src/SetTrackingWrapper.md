### Exemple ###

```php
use MapaDirectSDK\MDApiClient;

$orderId = 123;
$tracking = [
   "comments" => "Colissimo https://tracking.colissimo.com/FDSXXX",
   "trackign_number" => "FDSXXX",
   "products" => [
        "123456" => 3
   ]
];

$wrapper = MDApiClient::getWrapper('SetTracking');
$wrapper->setToken($apiKey);
$wrapper->setSiret($siret);
$wrapper->setId($orderId);
$wrapper->setInput($tracking);

$client = new MDApiClient();
try {
    $client->call($wrapper);
} catch (MDApiWrapperValidatorException $e) {
    // List of errors returned by the SDK 
    $client->getErrors();
    exit;
}

if ($client->getResponse()->isSuccess()) {
    $data = $client->getResponse()->getContent();
} else {
    $data = $client->getResponse()->getContent();
    // List of errors returned by the API 
}
```

NB : To respect the nomenclature of the call of the MAPAdirect webservices,
the SDK allows to enter the order id `order_id` by defining it by setId which
will complete the request'

`$data` returns a php table as described in the answer's body.
