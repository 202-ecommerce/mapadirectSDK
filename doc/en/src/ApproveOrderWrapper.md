### Exemple ###

```php
use MapaDirectSDK\MDApiClient;

$orderId = 123;

$wrapper = MDApiClient::getWrapper('ApproveOrder');
$wrapper->setToken($apiKey);
$wrapper->setSiret($siret);
$wrapper->setId($orderId);

$client = new MDApiClient();
try {
    $client->call($wrapper);
} catch (MDApiWrapperValidatorException $e) {
    // List of errors returned by the SDK
    $client->getErrors();
    exit;
}

if ($client->getResponse()->isSuccess()) {
    $data = $client->getResponse()->getContent();
} else {
    $data = $client->getResponse()->getContent();
    // List of errors returned by the API 
}
```

`$data` returns a php table as described in the answer's body.
