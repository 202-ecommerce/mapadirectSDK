**It is very important to keep the matching between your product ID on your
  website and the ID on mapadirect marketplace.**

### Exemple ###

```php
use MapaDirectSDK\MDApiClient;

$inventory = new \stdClass;
$inventory->amount = (int) 123;
$inventory->price = (float) 15.0000;
$inventory->combination = [];

$product = [
    'product_code' => '1234565410333',
    'product' => 'Very comfortable chair',
    'infinite_stock' => 0,
    'status' => 'A',
    'green_tax' => 0.99,
    'free_shipping' => 'N',
    'main_category' => 1932,
    'tax_ids' => [5],
    'inventory' => [$inventory]
];

$wrapper = MDApiClient::getWrapper('AddProduct');
$wrapper->setToken($apiKey);
$wrapper->setSiret($siret);
$wrapper->setInput($product);

$client = new MDApiClient();
try {
    $client->call($wrapper);
} catch (MDApiWrapperValidatorException $e) {
    // Liste des erreurs retournÃ©es par le SDK
    $client->getErrors();
    exit;
}

$data = $client->getResponse()->getContent();
if ($client->getResponse()->isSuccess()) {
    $data = $client->getResponse()->getContent();
} else {
    // Sorry but the API returns an error 500 in case of submission of incorrect data...
    // That's why we have set up a very strict validator in the SDK with all the known error cases.
}
```

`$data` returns a ohp array as described in the answer body.
