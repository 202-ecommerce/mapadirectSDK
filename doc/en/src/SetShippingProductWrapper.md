Answer's body:

```application/json
{
  "shipping_id": 0,
  "status": "A",
  "shipping": "TNT Express",
  "delivery_time": "24h",
  "rates": [
    {
      "amount": 0,
      "value": 3.99
    },
    {
      "amount": 1,
      "value": 1.99
    }
  ],
  "description": "<p>TNT shipping without tracking.</p>"
}
```


The first value of "rates" corresponds to the shipping fees for the purchase
of a product. If a second value is given, the following products will have
shipping fees corresponding to this second value.


### Exemple ###

```php
use MapaDirectSDK\MDApiClient;

$productId = 123;
$productShipping = [
    "status": "A",
    "rates" => [
        [
            "amount": 0,
            "value": 3.99

        ],[
            "amount": 1,
            "value": 1.99
        ]
    ]
];

$wrapper = MDApiClient::getWrapper('SetShippingProduct');
$wrapper->setToken($apiKey);
$wrapper->setSiret($siret);
$wrapper->setId($productId);
$wrapper->setInput($productShipping);

$client = new MDApiClient();
try {
    $client->call($wrapper);
} catch (MDApiWrapperValidatorException $e) {
    // List of errors returned by the SDK
    $client->getErrors();
    exit;
}

if ($client->getResponse()->isSuccess()) {
    $data = $client->getResponse()->getContent();
} else {
    // Sorry but the API returns an error 500...
    // That's why we have set up a very strict validator in this SDK with every case of known error.
}
```

`$data` returns a php table as described in the answer's body.
